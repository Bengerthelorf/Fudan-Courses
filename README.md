# Fudan University Course Codes

This project is a collection of codes and other relevant content for various courses offered by Fudan University. It is created by me, a student of Fudan University, as part of my course assignment. I welcome everyone who is interested in learning from these courses to use this project as a resource. I also invite anyone who has taken these courses or has any useful content to share to contribute to this project. However, please make sure that you upload your files in a well-organized and categorized way, following the existing structure and naming conventions.

## How to use this project

This project is hosted on GitHub, a platform for version control and collaboration. You can access this project from any system that has a web browser and an internet connection. However, if you want to download, edit, or upload files, you will need some additional tools and steps depending on your system.

### Linux

If you are using Linux, you will need to install Git, a command-line tool for working with GitHub repositories. You can install Git using your system's package manager, such as `apt` or `yum`. For example, on Ubuntu or Debian, you can run the following command in a terminal:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git
```

Once you have Git installed, you can clone this project to your local machine by running the following command in a terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bengerthelorf/Fudan-Courses.git
```

This will create a folder named `fudan-course-notes` in your current directory, containing all the files from this project. You can then navigate to this folder and edit or add files as you wish. To upload your changes to GitHub, you will need to follow these steps:

1. Add the files that you want to upload to the staging area by running the following command:

```bash
git add .
```

This will add all the files in the current directory and its subdirectories. If you want to add specific files, you can specify their names or paths instead of `.`.

2. Commit the changes with a message describing what you have done by running the following command:

```bash
git commit -m "your message here"
```

3. Push the changes to GitHub by running the following command:

```bash
git push origin main
```

This will upload your changes to the main branch of this project on GitHub. You may need to enter your GitHub username and password or use a personal access token for authentication.

### Windows

If you are using Windows, you will need to install GitHub Desktop, a graphical user interface tool for working with GitHub repositories. You can download GitHub Desktop from [here](https://desktop.github.com/) and follow the installation instructions.

Once you have GitHub Desktop installed, you can clone this project to your local machine by clicking on the `Code` button on this project's page on GitHub and selecting `Open with GitHub Desktop`. This will launch GitHub Desktop and prompt you to choose a location where you want to save this project.

After cloning this project, you can open it in your preferred editor or IDE and edit or add files as you wish. To upload your changes to GitHub, you will need to follow these steps:

1. In GitHub Desktop, click on the `Changes` tab on the left panel and review the files that you have modified or added.
2. In the bottom left corner, enter a summary and an optional description for your changes and click on `Commit to main`.
3. In the top right corner, click on `Push origin` to upload your changes to GitHub.

### Mac OS

If you are using Mac OS, you can either use Git or GitHub Desktop as described above for Linux and Windows respectively. Git comes pre-installed on most Mac OS systems, but if not, you can install it from [here](https://git-scm.com/download/mac). Alternatively, you can download GitHub Desktop for Mac OS from [here](https://central.github.com/deployments/desktop/desktop/latest/darwin) and follow the installation instructions.
